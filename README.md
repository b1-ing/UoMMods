   - The application will be running with hot-reload enabled

### Data Scraping Setup

To update course data from University of Manchester sources:

1. **Configure scraping environment**
   ```bash
   # Ensure Python virtual environment is activated
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

2. **Run course data scraper**

   python scrape_course_data.py
   ```

3. **Process marks data** (if PDF available)
   ```bash
   python marks_scraper.py
   ```

## üß™ Development

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build Next.js application for production
cd uommods
npm run build
```

### Linting

### Testing
Currently, no automated testing framework is configured. Manual testing guidelines:

1. **Frontend Testing**: Test all user interactions in the course planner
2. **Data Integrity**: Verify scraped data accuracy against university sources
3. **Performance**: Monitor page load times and search responsiveness
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## üìä Data Sources

The system maintains up-to-date course information through automated scraping of:

- University of Manchester course catalogues
- Module descriptions and requirements
- Assessment breakdowns and weightings
- Historical grade distributions
- Prerequisite and corequisite relationships

Data is processed and stored in Supabase for real-time access and synchronization across the application.
