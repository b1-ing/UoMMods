Among others, the module discusses architecture terminology (how do we talk about computer systems), models (how do we think about computer systems), topologies (how are computers structured), how programs are executed by the hardware, and how data (whether numbers, text, colours, or polygons) are represented in hardware using only binary digits. Understanding the Fundamentals of Computer Architecture is essential for being able to reason about what exactly happens when we run a program. This is important not just for hardware designers and low level (Operating System, embedded) software developers, but for everyone that wants to create high performing, but still correct, software. As such, it is an increasingly important skill in Computer Science roles in business and finance. More generally, demystifying Computer Systems gives students a strong competitive advantage relative to developers that have no concept of what their code does, whether these developers are human ones or AI models. To be more specific, the course will help students: Understand the basic Von Neumann/Imperative computational model.   Understand the binary nature of digital computers, and how bit patterns can be used to represent such things as characters, numbers, and instructions.   Understand the essentials of the RISC-V instruction set and its registers.   Be able to understand the basics of assembly language programs.   Understand the correspondence between imperative code & data and assembly language.   Reason about the roles and interplay of the standard components of System Software (Compiler, Assembler, Library, Linker, Loader, Interpreter and Operating System), including how they are influenced by the design decision of the underlying computer hardware. Key and Cognitive skills: The module will expand the student's vocabulary with respect to the technical terminology of Computer Architecture, while also providing the cognitive foundation for understanding the design and operation of Computer Systems. Over the course of this module, the students will become able to reason about how programs are executed, how data is stored, and how to make programs faster. The student will be empowered to learn through multi-format lectures and Self-study-learning techniques. New concepts are introduced through pre-recorded Lectures, then these concepts are re-examined in a more practical context in Live Lectures. Each pre-recorded lecture comes with a set of associated formative (unmarked) questions that helps students get immediate feedback about their understanding of the material. Additionally, students can take part in an interactive quiz in the live lecture to gauge how well they are doing relative to the rest of the cohort. Question sets that test wider parts of the taught material are released every two weeks. Finally, the lectures are supported by a set of Lab assignments that expand and solidify the studentâs knowledge through a âlearning by doingâ approach.",,,,70%,30%,,,,,,

By modelling systems mathematically it is possible to analyse them, and make predictions about their performance and how it can be optimised. Solution of these mathematical systems often relies on computational hardware and the application of algorithms which solve an approximate form of the problem. It is therefore important to understand the limitations imposed by the computational implementation of a given problem, and the effect this can have on a given solution.   The course explores these concepts from three perspectives: by introducing the notion of finite precision computation and error propagation within a computational process; through exploring techniques for the numerical solution of differential equations; and through the use of optimisation algorithms to maximise the performance of a solution to a given problem. These techniques are then applied to real-world problems, including physical and engineering systems, and machine learning operations within neural networks. The course targets students seeking to gain experience of how numerical computation is employed in industry and research, and who want a deeper understanding of how numerical algorithms and hardware combine when solving problems. It will help develop the skills necessary to work at the hardware-software interface, and in harnessing the power of hardware accelerators and modern computer architectures to develop fast, accurate and precise analysis tools.",100%,,,,,,,,,,

This is an opportunity for you to explore an area of interest while building useful skills for your career. The syllabus will include material on topics such as: finding and evaluating course material, creating effective graphics, recording videos, why explaining is hard, giving useful feedback, and similar. Where possible it will also include guest lectures discussing how and how often these skills are used in industry. *(topic will be agreed between you and the unit tutor)",,,,,,,,24,,,
