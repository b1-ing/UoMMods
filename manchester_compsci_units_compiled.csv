As a mathematical discipline, Differential Geometry explores the geometry of smooth shapes. To do this, it uses tools from various areas of mathematics, such as differential calculus, integral calculus and linear algebra. In Differential Geometry we use analytic and algebraic techniques to formalise the intuitive notions of distance, angle and curvature to study the extrinsic properties of curves (parameterised by arc length). Some of these properties are then used more generally to study the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of surfaces. For instance, since the time of Euclid it was understood that a straight line provides the shortest distance between two points; however, how do you find this distance if the points lie in the surface of the earth (which is not flat). This leads to the important concept of geodesics where one uses the idea that great circles are locally similar to straight lines in a flat plane. In this module we will explore several notions around smooth parameterised curves, such as tangent vectors, curvature, osculating planes, and the Frenet moving frame.

If we take a straight line  L  and a point  p  not on that line, then there is a unique straight line through  p  that never intersects  L  (draw a picture!). This is Euclid's parallel postulate. Euclid introduced several axioms for what is now called Euclidean geometry (that is, geometry in  R 2  or more generally in R n  and a great deal of effort was employed in attempting to prove that these axioms implied the parallel postulate. However, in early 19th century, the hyperbolic plane was introduced as a setting in which Euclid's axioms hold but the parallel postulate fails: there may be infinitely many ""straight"" lines through a point that do not intersect a given ""straight"" line. Today, hyperbolic geometry is a rich and active area of mathematics with many beautiful theorems (and can be used to generate very  attractive pictures ) This course provides an introduction to hyperbolic geometry. We start by discussing what is meant by ""distance"" and what is ""straight"" about a straight line in the Euclidean plane  R 2 . We then give an introduction to the hyperbolic plane. Topics include: distance and area in the hyperbolic plane, distance-preserving maps, hyperbolic trigonometry and hyperbolic polygons. The collection of all distance-preserving maps forms a group. The second part of the course studies a particular class of such groups, namely Fuchsian groups. By using a very beautiful theorem called Poincaré's Theorem, we will describe the connections between such groups and tessellations (tilings) of the hyperbolic plane.

The combinatorial half of this course is concerned with enumeration, that is, given a family of problems P(n), n a natural number, find a(n), the number of solutions of P(n) for each such n. The basic device is the generating function, a function F(t) that can be found directly from a description of the problem and for which there exists an expansion in the form F(t) = sum {a(n)gn(t); n a natural number}.

In Set Theory we will first give a non-axiomatic approach to infinite numbers and how to do basic calculations with them. Historically this is how the subject began, when G. Cantor realised that ordinary arithmetic can be extended to the infinite. We will focus on ordinal and cardinal numbers and start with a brief introduction to ordered sets. In Predicate Logic we will set up so called first order languages in which mathematics can be formalized and mathematical methods can be applied. Hence the informal notion of a ’formula’ will become a mathematical object, amenable to tools and methods from the subject. For example one can ask if there is a computer, which in principle is able to find all true statements about mathematics (this was a driving force at the beginning of the discipline). It turned out that such a computer cannot exist. The crux here is that this statement has a rigorous mathematical proof, which necessitates the translation of clauses like “true statements about mathematics” and “can be proved” into mathematical statements itself. This part of the course will give a thorough exposition of this translation together with the fundamental theorems saying that the translation is correct (Soundness Theorem) and optimal (Completeness Theorem). General mathematical structures (like groups, vector spaces or ordered sets) will be used to exemplify formulas of first order logic. A formula can be thought of a generalisation of an equation, but now we are also allowing quantifiers. The tools developed in the course will be used to analyse solution sets of such formulas (called ’definable sets’). Furthermore the methods allow a classification of mathematical structures according to the properties of their definable sets. This for example connects a priori different looking structures (think of a group and an ordered set) in surprising ways. The course will make first steps in this direction with illustrations in the complex and the real field. After having established the fundamentals of Predicate Logic we will revisit Set Theory from an axiomatic point of view. We state and discuss Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory as well as immediate applications of the Completeness Theorem to Set Theory.","[{'course_code': 'MATH33021', 'assessment_type_id': 4, 'percentage': 1.0}]",,,False,3,,"[{'course_code': 'MATH33021', 'schedule_type_id': 1, 'hours': 2.75}, {'course_code': 'MATH33021', 'schedule_type_id': 3, 'hours': 1.8333333333333333}, {'course_code': 'MATH33021', 'schedule_type_id': 4, 'hours': 12.083333333333334}]",Semester 1

Initially we start with analysis of stress and strain and look at constitutive relations and examine the differences between solids and fluids. We then concentrate on the linearised theory of elasticity. A typical problem of the subject is as follows: Suppose an elastic body (e.g. an underground oil pipe) is subjected to some loading on its outer surface. What is the stress distribution which is generated throughout the body? Does this stress distribution have unexpectedly large values which might lead to failure? The subject is developed, and particular problems solved, from a mathematical standpoint. In the second half of the course, we continue the discussion of stresses and strains but now focussing on how they impact viscous fluid flow. We first derive the governing nonlinear equations – the Navier-Stokes equations using conservation principles.

To achieve this, a mathematical model is developed and then solved for different types of problems. It is assumed that students will be familiar with financial terms, stochastic differential equations, and partial differential equations. It is shown that mathematical methods developed to solve Partial Differential Equations can be powerful tools in solving financial problems once suitable models have been devised.","[{'course_code': 'MATH39032', 'assessment_type_id': 4, 'percentage': 1.0}]",,,False,3,"MATH20912,MATH24420,PHYS20171,MATH20401,MATH20411","[{'course_code': 'MATH39032', 'schedule_type_id': 1, 'hours': 1.0}, {'course_code': 'MATH39032', 'schedule_type_id': 3, 'hours': 1.0}, {'course_code': 'MATH39032', 'schedule_type_id': 4, 'hours': 6.333333333333333}]",Semester 2

Allow students to understand and develop the necessary skills to produce a proposal to support a major project within an organisation or a business plan for a new start-up. 2. Introduce essential business finance and business risk management tools. 3. To explore resources required to form, develop and grow a business or a product line within a business. 4. To encourage students to think entrepreneurially as an essential component of their personal development.","[{'course_code': 'MCEL30032', 'assessment_type_id': 8, 'percentage': None}, {'course_code': 'MCEL30032', 'assessment_type_id': 9, 'percentage': None}, {'course_code': 'MCEL30032', 'assessment_type_id': 10, 'percentage': 1.0}]",,,False,3,,"[{'course_code': 'MCEL30032', 'schedule_type_id': 1, 'hours': 2.0}, {'course_code': 'MCEL30032', 'schedule_type_id': 4, 'hours': 6.333333333333333}]",Semester 2
